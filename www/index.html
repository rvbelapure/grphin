          <b>About this Graph:</b><br/><br/>
          How are employees moving between companies?<br/><br/>
          We seek to answer this question by building a directed graph, in which:
          <ul>
          <li>Nodes represent companies</li>
          <li>Edges represent the flow of people between two companies </li>
          </ul>
          <b>About the Data:</b><br/><br/>
          We parsed 7,207,357 LinkedIn public profiles - which resulted in a graph containing 3,215,402 nodes and 3,574,637 unique edges.<br/><br/>
          Next we filter out “uninteresting” nodes and edges by setting a threshold. In this case, nodes and edges that appeared in <40 profiles are discarded (with a few whitelisted exemptions). The result is a disconnected graph with isolated groups of nodes and edges.<br/><br/>
          Next, we build a single connected graph, by running breadth-first-search from the single largest company node (IBM) in the original graph.<br/><br/>
          The resulting graph has 51 companies, along with 121 unique edges.<br/><br/>
